<p>You came across as low energy.</p>
<p><em>Prospective employer&rsquo;s feedback, not entirely appreciated by me</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, I didn&rsquo;t get the job.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve certainly had my fair share of catastrophic interviews. The one where I mixed up whether the company used PHP or Perl. The lunch from which any testimony would have convicted my prospective employer of just about any <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/">EEOC</a> lawsuit. The one where my would-be boss challenged the technical merit of the approach I&rsquo;d co-designed and developed to handle complex radio routing requirements in life-and-death situations<sup id="fnref:police"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:police">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>But being told I might not have enough energy for the job&hellip;that hurt.</p>
<p>I was tempted, of course, to just blow it off. And that might be the right answer. But as a teacher of mine once said, failure hurts, so you might as well squeeze every possible lesson out of it.</p>
<p>Part of why the feedback stings is because it ties into what I know is a weakness &ndash; figuring out how to make the right first impression, the juggling act between confidence and arrogance, between listening well and giving answers in a time-limited scenario, showing appropriate interest while recognizing that the interview process is about discovering and evaluating unknowns.</p>
<p>And in this interview, I&rsquo;d thought I&rsquo;d found a balance of those traits that was really me and a good fit for the situation&hellip;only to get completely rejected.</p>
<h1 id="the-interview">The interview</h1>
<p>How did it all start? An acquaintance, Bob, who knew I was looking for a job, reached out. He had some openings and wanted to know if I might be interested. Our conversation went well, and I was invited out to see the company and see if there might be a fit.</p>
<p>This was all very informal. There was no job description, no hiring manager or recruiter, no details about the company other than what was publicly available. &ldquo;Just&rdquo; a chance to come in and chat<sup id="fnref:technical"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:technical">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Arriving at the company, I met Bob and Bob&rsquo;s boss Charles. I&rsquo;d carefully prepared to listen, to learn about what the company needed, and to see where there might be good synergy between my skills and their needs.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;So what do you want to do for the company?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Charles asked that question a few minutes into the conversation. I had no idea; after all, that was supposed to be the whole point of the casual conversation? I tried to gently and diplomatically bounce the question back:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Part of why I&rsquo;m here is to figure out what would make a great opportunity for both of us.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>At least, I tried to say something to that effect. Let&rsquo;s leave whether or not I was exactly that quick thinking on my feet to the imagination.</p>
<p>Charles was not happy, at least according to his body language. I tried to engage him and draw him out &ndash; at least as well as I could while he and Bob were driving the interview questions. But Charles&rsquo;s body language continued to be hostile and disengaged.</p>
<p>And after perhaps half an hour, that was the interview. There was nothing casual or low-key about the conversation. Charles came across as hurried. He or Bob drove the conversation the whole time, and my efforts to create a back-and-forth exchange fell spectacularly flat.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not surprised I didn&rsquo;t get an offer, but being described as low energy surprised me.</p>
<h1 id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned</h1>
<p>One of the downsides of interviews is they are all special snowflakes. But here are a few of the takeaways that I&rsquo;ve mulled over:</p>
<p><strong>Win</strong>: <em>Going in with a loose game plan to listen and find mutual wins.</em></p>
<p>I like to make detailed plans. I like to know exactly what I&rsquo;m getting into. I like having three or four contingency plans. Even though it worked out terribly in this scenario, I think going in with goals, some prepared questions to help me get to those goals, and the right mindset was the right approach.</p>
<p><strong>Win</strong>: <em>Letting the company drive the interview.</em></p>
<p>Some of the interview advice I&rsquo;ve heard more or less suggests that candidates take over the interview and run it. I have friends who can &ndash; and have &ndash; pulled that off in interviews.</p>
<p>But I find it disrespectful, especially when companies usually have crafted the interview process for their own evaluation process. I&rsquo;ve rarely seen it done well in interviews when I&rsquo;m the interviewer. Even though there was clearly more latitude here with a more informal process, I still don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s respectful to snatch control of the conversation.</p>
<p><strong>Win</strong>: <em>Being prepared to drive the conversation.</em></p>
<p>I went in well prepared, if an opening was presented, to lead the conversation in learning what a win-win scenario might look like. I feel good about trying to establish a back-and-forth exchange within the confines of the interview format.</p>
<p><strong>Loss</strong>: <em>Not openly (re)setting expectations.</em></p>
<p>In hindsight, I wish I had stopped a bit into the interview and said something like. &ldquo;Bob, Charles, can we step back for a moment? My understanding is that I&rsquo;m here so we can have a casual conversation about whether there&rsquo;s a position that would be a win-win scenario for both of us. Is that your understanding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what Charles was told. I don&rsquo;t know what Bob thought he&rsquo;d told me. But it seems really likely that expectations were mismatched, and I wish I&rsquo;d been quick thinking enough to have tried to make sure we were on the same page.</p>
<p><strong>Maybe</strong>: <em>Not openly setting expectations before the visit.</em></p>
<p>As the saying goes, a good presentation consists of:
* Telling them what you are going to tell them.
* Telling them.
* Telling them what you&rsquo;ve told them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of value in having a clear goal for any meeting, and I ponder if I should have dropped Bob a note a day or two before my meeting said something like, &ldquo;Looking forward to getting together. In my mind, we&rsquo;re casually chatting to see if there&rsquo;s a win-win opportunity as well as doing some technical evaluation. Does that sound right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it would have helped, but it might have made sure at least Bob and I were on the same page.</p>
<p><strong>Musing</strong>: <em>Maybe energy wasn&rsquo;t the issue.</em></p>
<p>After mulling it over, I&rsquo;m not entirely sure how to interpret Bob&rsquo;s low energy comment. There&rsquo;s the straight-forward interpretation &ndash; I didn&rsquo;t come across as engaged during the interview. And that might be true, especially since I know I was trying to parse Charles&rsquo;s lack of engagement and figure out how to adjust. But I also ponder a couple other interpretations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Charles doesn&rsquo;t like you, and the easiest way to describe his dislike is &ldquo;low energy.&rdquo;</em> Totally fair; it was pretty clear that Charles and I would be at least something of an acquired taste for each other. And depending on how aware Bob was of Charles&rsquo;s reaction and how openly Bob can speak about it, maybe &ldquo;low energy&rdquo; is as close as it gets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>We want employees who are really enthusiastic about the opportunity, even before they know anything about it.</em> I&rsquo;ve run into this in other interviews &ndash; employers often want people to be very excited about the opportunity before they&rsquo;ve said much. In contrast, I tend to be very aware of how much is unknown and respond with cautious optimism.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="so-what">So what</h1>
<p>My final thought is that, while it&rsquo;s great to wring as many lessons as possible from failure &ndash; and preferably the failure of others, because it is a whole lot less painful than going through it myself &ndash; at the end of the day, interviews can&rsquo;t be taken too seriously.</p>
<p>Almost by definition, everyone has more losses than wins when it comes to interviewing: You keep interviewing until you take a job. And for all that one tries to put their best foot forward, so much can go wrong that is totally not under one&rsquo;s control. Sometimes people won&rsquo;t understand you, and that&rsquo;s okay. Learn to get a good laugh out of it &ndash; or at least a blog article &ndash; and move on.</p>
<p>What do you think? What lessons would you have taken away from such an interview?</p>
<div class="footnote">

<ol>
<li id="fn:police">
<p>These were police radios, and officers relied on what I&rsquo;d done to be able to talk reliably to different responders and agencies in a wide variety of scenarios. Sometimes, for example, they needed to temporarily switch channels and then have the radio automatically switch back in a few seconds, unless there was a manual request to switch to a different channel. The requirements for stitching together multiple incompatible radio systems were&hellip;special.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:police" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:technical">
<p>At some point during my visit, there was also some time set aside for a technical evaluation. I don&rsquo;t remember if that was explicitly stated before the visit or not, but I&rsquo;d certainly anticipated that happening. When chatting about the interview results, the company&rsquo;s feedback was that I&rsquo;d nailed it technically (and that was my own assessment as well), so I&rsquo;ve omitted the technical aspect of the interview as it doesn&rsquo;t seem relevant.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:technical" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
