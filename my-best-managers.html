<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>95% of what I’ve learned about great management comes from two managers and a book<sup id="fnref:wander"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:wander">1</a></sup>.
Me, reflecting about my management style</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve had plenty of bosses over the years – some good, a few too busy to pay attention to me, a few not so good<sup id="fnref:horror"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:horror">7</a></sup>. And I’ve probably read – or at least skimmed – dozens of books on leadership.</p>
<p>So how did Ella and Emma make such an impression?</p>
<ul>
<li>Radical trust.</li>
<li>Sincere respect.</li>
<li>Consistent candor.</li>
<li>Seen potential.</li>
<li>Warm appreciation.</li>
<li>Low expectations.</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s nothing particularly radical about this list (except the last one, I’ll get to that), but experiencing that kind of leadership was profoundly connecting. Not only do some of my fondest memories of work come from those times, but it also radically reshaped what I aspire to in my interactions with others.</p>
<h1 id="story-time">Story time</h1>
<p>Here are five stories (and an observation) illustrating how these principles played out…</p>
<h2 id="ella-and-the-competitor">Ella and the competitor</h2>
<p>When I interviewed with Ella, I also had an interview lined up at a scientific facility – the kind of place that sounds really fancy and makes for a unique interview opportunity. The timing was a bit awkward, but Ella’s response when I asked for a couple more days to respond to her offer so I could get a sense for the facility stuck with me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Certainly; you should absolutely interview there – it’s a really cool opportunity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, Ella got where I was coming from and supported me getting a chance at a rare opportunity<sup id="fnref:hindsight"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:hindsight">2</a></sup><sup id="fnref:choice"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:choice">3</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="ella-and-waf">Ella and waf</h2>
<p>Shortly after I started working for Ella, I was tech lead on a small team looking to resurrect an application (all the previous institutional knowledge had moved on) and add some key product features. After some investigation, I went to Ella with a pitch to spend a significant amount of time (a couple of months, as I recall) building out some build infrastructure for the application.</p>
<p>I was really nervous about asking, and I wasn’t totally sure I could justify the ROI. After all, build infrastructure wasn’t exactly a new feature we could ship, and I wasn’t really sure that better build capabilities would help us ship the first feature sooner.</p>
<p>But Ella simply said yes; she trusted my judgement. I still don’t know if that was the best technical call<sup id="fnref:call"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:call">4</a></sup>. But it was absolutely the right relational call.</p>
<p>I ended up building a <a href="https://waf.io/book/">waf-based system</a> for the application. Waf<sup id="fnref:waf"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:waf">5</a></sup> would go on to be build framework for large portions of the company’s code base for over a decade. And for bonus points, the build system paid huge dividends early on as well, and the new feature shipped far ahead of Ella’s expectations.</p>
<h2 id="christmas-party">Christmas party</h2>
<p>The final memory I have of Ella from that first year is the company Christmas party. I’d only been working with Ella a few months at that point, but she made a point to greet my wife and I, and to tell my wife how much she appreciated my presence and contributions at the company. That moment embodied the kind of sincere warmth and thoughtful presence that Ella so often exhibited in our conversations.</p>
<h2 id="emma-individualized">Emma, individualized</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Why do you work here?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t recall how long it took for Emma to ask that question after she started managing me. Under a month. Possibly the second time we met.</p>
<p><em>“I don’t care why you work here, but I need to know why in order to be a good manager.”</em></p>
<p>The question led into a really good conversation about what I valued directly (e.g., respect of co-workers) and how often what a company is willing to pay is an accurate signal of how much they value and respect a person’s work. This was the first of many good conversations with Emma. Beyond that, I learned that Emma cared about tailoring her management style on an individual basis. Case in point, I mentioned that I’d never gotten one of the company’s “above and beyond” thank yous (and we both knew that I’d more than earned a few). Not too long later, the company CEO dropped by to give me one.</p>
<h2 id="emmas-questions">Emma’s questions</h2>
<p>Emma wasn’t a technical boss, but she made up for it by asking for my opinion about everything. Why was such-n-such a problem? How did this technology work? Would such-n-so an approach be faster? Why or why not? Why was testing a hard part of software development?</p>
<p>And Emma was asking to learn. She knew she didn’t understand the technology, and it lead to great exchanges where we talked about trade-offs, implications, and costs. And Emma often brought up apparent contradictions (either ideas she’d learned from developers or something I’d said) and asked me about them. The conversations helped me to refine and grow my perspectives, but I always had the sense that Emma had a great respect for my views and understanding.</p>
<h2 id="emma-and-the-shadow-project-manager">Emma and the shadow project manager</h2>
<p>One of the first projects that I tackled with Emma was rewriting the control software for some mission-critical company algorithms. I was officially tech lead for a small team and, on paper, Emma was both engineering and project manager.</p>
<p>However, the project was a highly technical one where almost every story and prioritization choice involved a great deal of technical expertise. Emma saw this, saw that I was good at organization and structuring work, and said, “Go ahead and structure the work as you see fit.” So for a couple years, I basically got to be the shadow project manager as I organized, structured, and prioritized the work.</p>
<p>A lesser project manager might have been threatened or territorial or wanted to be more in the loop, but Emma trusted me to bring up the choices that had business impact and to make the right technical decisions around the work.</p>
<p>Beyond that, Emma believed that I could be a good manager and encouraged me that I could do it if I wanted to. At the time, I hadn’t had any managers who had modeled a style that felt like my style, but working with Emma, doing that kind of organizational project work, and having that kind of trust gave me a sense of how I could be an effective manager with my own style.</p>
<h2 id="candor-and-personalization">Candor and personalization</h2>
<p>Finally, I recall two other attributes of my time with both Ella and Emma:</p>
<p>First, they were straight with me about the hard questions. I got real answers to question like <em>“Why is the organization doing such-n-such?”</em> or <em>“Is this-or-that really fulfilling our corporate values?</em></p>
<p>While they respected the necessary corporate privacy, they typically erred on the side of sharing more and trusting me to be discreet. There were at least a few times when I knew well ahead of time about a pending reorg or upcoming departure. Again, the idea of extending trust shows up.</p>
<p>And finally, they had low expectations for me. They recognized, I believe, that I have incredibly high expectations for myself (some might say unrealistic) and that I do my best work when I’m not feeling pressured to do even more. And so they were able to find meaningful ways to tell me that I was doing great, which helped me to do even better.</p>
<p>Clearly that exact strategy doesn’t apply to every employee, but the broader principle of understanding each employee and adjusting one’s approach accordingly is absolutely applicable. And I have yet to meet an employee who doesn’t like to know how their work is appreciated.</p>
<h1 id="so-what">So what</h1>
<p>I generally opt for a pretty simple management philosophy:</p>
<p><strong>My goal is to make others shine.</strong></p>
<p>If I can create a team where I’m not necessary, that’s fantastic. One of the best compliments of my management came after I’d been away from one of my teams for a while, when I was told, “They’re the team in the engineering department that least needs a manager.” In other words, they were highly productive and self-directing, regardless of whether I was around or not. Beyond that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be credible. I say what I mean, and I mean what I say. I may be mistaken, but people don’t need to worry that I’m snowing them.</li>
<li>Manage by wandering around (perhaps virtually), chatting, and building relationships.</li>
<li>Let others leverage their strengths to build the team. I’m not a natural encourager or connector, so I let others with those talents take the lead. While I do need to grow, I don’t need to do all the work myself, and I don’t need to be the one with all the answers (especially if I’m trying to make myself unnecessary).</li>
<li>Be thoughtfully present.<ul>
<li>Can I tell you the unique contributions of each team member? Do the reviews I write reflect that I’m in touch with the employee’s successes, growth, and ambitions?</li>
<li>Can I tell you how I’m utilizing their individual strengths and passions in how I’ve allocated work?</li>
<li>When confronted with someone’s weakness, am I immediately reacting to that weakness, or am I seeking to understand what is leading to the expression of that weakness?</li>
<li>If anything I’m going to write on someone’s review will surprise them, then I’m failing as a manager and need to adjust.</li>
<li>If I’m going to write a bad review for someone<sup id="fnref:review"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:review">6</a></sup>, have I gone above and beyond to make sure it is the employee who is the problem and not the way I’m managing?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This certainly isn’t an exhaustive list; much of this is shaped by what I’m naturally weak at and thus needs extra attention. For example, I naturally bring about organization and structure; what I need to focus on is relationships and spontaneity. So managing by wandering around helps provide those opportunities and “structures” unstructured time for me.</p>
<p>But in a nutshell, that captures an awful lot of what I’ve learned from my best managers. After all, good management is really pretty simple most of the time – the only hard part is living it out consistently.</p>
<h1 id="soapbox-bonus">Soapbox bonus</h1>
<p>I posit three factors are behind the stark dichotomy between the plethora of management books and the shortage of good managers.</p>
<ol>
<li>The head-knowledge for being a great leader is quite straightforward (thus, so many books).</li>
<li>The character mastery for being a great leader is exceptionally challenging. As the saying goes, policy is for when one lacks either the character or the experience for the situation<sup id="fnref:policy"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:policy">8</a></sup>.</li>
<li>As a whole, businesses aren’t persuaded that great managers really make that much of a difference.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, while there is a no storage of lip service to the idea that great managers are essential, when rubber meets the road, other realities often win out.</p>
<p>Too cynical? Perhaps.</p>
<p>Maybe I’ll do a more in-depth reflection about the organizational challenges around great managers in the future.</p>
<div class="footnote">

<ol>
<li id="fn:wander">
<p>I don’t even remember the book, but it introduced me to <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/a79izhx/management-by-wandering-around-mbwa">management by wandering around</a>. <em>First, Break All The Rules</em> by Don Clifton also deserves a hat tip for articulating many of these ideas. <a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:wander" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:hindsight">
<p>In hindsight, I probably could have accepted Ella’s offer and then gone to the interview anyway, so Ella’s response may have also just been good negotiation to make sure she got a real yes. <a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:hindsight" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:choice">
<p>As it turned out, the other interview was catastrophically bad – like, “the hiring manager flagrantly violating EEOC regulations with off-hand comments to me during the interview” bad – so at the end of the day, the job choice was pretty easy. <a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:choice" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:call">
<p>The decision worked out really well, so in hindsight it is easy to say it was the right one, but I ponder whether there was a better call with the information available at the time. <a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:call" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:waf">
<p>At the time, waf clearly beat out the open source competition, especially choices like <em>make</em> (shudder). I haven’t kept up with it for a number of years, but I suspect other tools such as <a href="https://nx.dev/">Nx</a> give it a run for its money today. <a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:waf" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:review">
<p>While, yes, problem employees do exist, most of the time, most people respond really well to good management. So starting with the assumption that it’s on me to do better covers most situations really well. <a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:review" title="Jump back to footnote 6 in the text">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:horror">
<p>Maybe I’ll do a follow-up along the lines of the <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/1310108">Bike Lesson</a></em>, where I share the invaluable lessons I learned from watching my bosses do it wrong. <a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:horror" title="Jump back to footnote 7 in the text">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:policy">
<p>That’s not to say that policy isn’t useful or necessary. But imagine a world where nearly every manager was an exceptional manager: How much policy would still be necessary? <a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:policy" title="Jump back to footnote 8 in the text">↩</a></p>
</li>
