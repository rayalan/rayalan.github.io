</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile</a> is supposed to be a new set of values, valuing individuals and interactions over processes and tools &ndash; among other things.</p>
<p>Yet when it comes to estimation, there seems to be a fascination with the process, regardless of the results. On paper, the Agile estimation process seems quite reasonable:</p>

  est[Estimate task size based on similar prior tasks]
  do[Do the work]
  calibrate[Improve estimation abilities based on actual outcomes]

  est --> do --> calibrate --> est
</div>

<p>The idea is that the team will be doing similar tasks for a long enough period that it&rsquo;s possible to chart the team&rsquo;s velocity and make reasonable approximations about when a project will finish.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s even a clever observation that humans are much better at comparison (an elephant is bigger than a tiger; a tiger is about the same size as a lion) than they are at precise estimates. So rather than estimating in time, Agile estimates in story points or T-shirt sizes or something similar. There&rsquo;s even the helpful observation that we don&rsquo;t need fine grained resolution &ndash; does it really matter if a card is 10 or 11 points? &ndash; and so many approaches use a variant of the Fibonacci sequence to reduce cognitive load.</p>
<p>What could go wrong?</p>
<h1 id="the-problems">The problems</h1>
<p>The first set of problems revolve around the assumptions being made:</p>
<p><em>The team will be doing similar tasks for a long enough period.</em></p>
<p>Many teams I know are often doing rather different tasks each sprint. The first time implementing redis. The first time implementing the new date/time picker. The first time implementing redis now that the new authentication protocols are in place. The second time implementing the new date/time picker, but Jane who did it last time is out on vacation and the design calls for a new serif font that&rsquo;s never been used.</p>
<p>In short, there aren&rsquo;t enough similarities between tasks to build up a familiar set of reference tickets. It&rsquo;s like playing Pictionary with a new group of people each time &ndash; there&rsquo;s no convention or groupthink to take advantage of.</p>
<p><em>Creating and maintaining the tickets has low overhead.</em></p>
<p>In order to get the benefit of estimating when a project will end, one needs most of the work to exist as tickets &ndash; and the tickets need to be small enough to be estimated. This is a significant amount of work, almost waterfall-like. All too often, new product requirements, implementation realities, or new organizational objectives end up shifting the necessary work. The result is either another massive effort to redefine all the work, or an obsolete project estimate. This problem gets worse the further ahead one is trying to estimate, as the more work that needs to be carefully defined, the more time is spent writing and rewriting tickets.</p>
<p><em>The team will spend the time to properly estimate.</em></p>
<p>Team estimation is a time-consuming task. Some of this is healthy, because it reveals differing assumptions about the work. But especially on a team with lots of unfamiliar tasks, hours can be spent coming to a consensus on estimates.</p>
<p>Teams aren&rsquo;t stupid; that&rsquo;s an incredible amount of time that most people don&rsquo;t enjoy&hellip;and so the process starts getting short-circuited. Individuals are asked to start estimating cards. That creates the estimates, but means there&rsquo;s even less of a team-wide sense of what any particular number means.</p>
<p><em>Companies often have competing rhythms.</em></p>
<p>While Agile promotes the idea of doing the most important work now, many companies have non-Agile rhythms that guide larger planning. Annual budgets. Quarterly OKRs. Six week <a href="https://www.productplan.com/glossary/shape-up-method/">Shape Up projects</a>. Often the scope of the project is largely driven by the available time and available personnel. Thus the question becomes &ldquo;What can these 2 people get done before the feature launch in ten weeks?&rdquo; far more than &ldquo;How can we accurately estimate the work that product wants to achieve?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Teams will spend the time to calibrate (improve) their estimation, based on actual results.</em></p>
<p>The idea is that, while a team may not be very good at estimating at first, by looking at how close their estimations were to reality (was this ticket really about the same size as this other one), teams can rapidly improve the accuracy of their estimation.</p>
<p>This might be true; I&rsquo;ve never heard of a team that actually had the discipline to calibrate their estimations, though.</p>
<p><em>Teams actually understand the majority of the work.</em></p>
<p>Preplanned tickets can be pretty good about what it takes to initially ship the feature. They&rsquo;re often very bad, though, at determining what needs to happen for the feature to be a success:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users aren&rsquo;t discovering the feature because it isn&rsquo;t listed on the user page, which is owned by another squad.</li>
<li>Users are generating several times more data than expected, and the database strategy can&rsquo;t handle the reads and writes.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, the third-party geolocation service often has high latency under load, so either a rework or a new provider is a necessity for continued growth.</li>
<li>User experience discovers a large uptick in complaints because the feature&rsquo;s biggest fans are enterprise customers, not the small companies the workflow was designed for.</li>
<li>This unexpected customer reaction has Product rethinking their approach.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The team capabilities are more or less interchangable.</em></p>
<p>In my career, I&rsquo;ve discovered that tasks are rarely interchangable. There&rsquo;s the one person who knows the legacy backend really well. The other developer who understands the intricacies of TypeScript. The one person who just rewrote the DateTime picker to be more usable, but nobody else understands the new pattern. And so on. As a result, there&rsquo;s really two velocities: The velocity when everyone is in their comfort zone, and the velocity that would occur if cards were being grabbed more or less at random.</p>
<p><em>The team will be more or less stable</em>.</p>
<p>Many companies are moving at fast paces. People join the team; people leave the team. At times, reorganization, leadership changes, and changing responsibilities are more the norm than the exception. Each organizational change causes the estimation process to get more uncertain.</p>
<p><em>Recap</em></p>
<p>So far, I&rsquo;ve looked at the process flaws that undermine most of the Agile estimation I&rsquo;m aware of. Even if people are going through the motions, the way that it is done isn&rsquo;t rigorous enough to achieve the intended result &ndash; semi-reliable estimates for when software will be done.</p>
<h1 id="the-value-problem">The value problem</h1>
<p>Worse yet, I can&rsquo;t think of a story of when an Agile-derived estimate mattered. When was the last time I saw any leader look at the team&rsquo;s velocity, look at the project story points, and say &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s about 100 points to finish; the team does about 20 points a cycle, so that&rsquo;s about 5 cycles out &ndash; say, 3 or 4 months?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On my first big project, I ran a very light-weight estimation process (no calibration, of course) and carefully tracked team velocity for about a year. I had a fantastic idea of how many story points happened each week. And it was completely irrelevant:</p>
<ul>
<li>I never used the data to estimate.</li>
<li>No leader ever asked about my estimation methodology.</li>
<li>Timelines changed based on changing requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, because the project did a good job of avoiding late-stage blow-ups and validated big unknowns upfront, timeline changes were relatively small and accepted as the uncertainties of software development. And in no scenario would more attention to estimation have done any good. If I were doing that project over again, I would have completely scrapped even the light-weight estimation that I did.</p>
<h1 id="the-process-problem">The process problem</h1>
<p>In a world that valued individuals and interactions over processes, one might expect that time-consuming and error-prone processes would be quickly slashed. Particularly if it wasn&rsquo;t generating useful outcomes for anybody. After all, a valueless time sink is terrible ROI. If nothing else, give employees a bit of extra PTO each week and earn some goodwill. The ROI is still terrible, but at least it is positive.</p>
<p>However, my observation has been that estimation has a habit of being sticky. People may not actually do it, particularly not the way that Agile suggests, but they are loath to abandon it.</p>
<p>I have a few ideas for why:</p>
<ul>
<li>Doing the standard thing rarely creates waves. All<sup id="fnref:all"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:all">1</a></sup> the books say estimation is the way to go.</li>
<li>It gives the illusion of impact. One can report &ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;ve got 20 points of work scheduled for this sprint,&rdquo; and it feels like something meaningful is being said.</li>
<li>People have the intuition that some sort of estimation is important, and Agile estimation is the standard procedure.</li>
</ul>
<p>But most importantly, many forms of Agile estimation are formulaic and thoughtless: something that can regularly happen in a rote fashion without much thought or consideration. And since the outcome doesn&rsquo;t really matter and people have the intuition that estimation matters, the estimation is seen as a productive signal.</p>
<p>In short, it becomes performative to &ldquo;signal&rdquo; that important work is happening, without consideration for whether the process is actually worthwhile.</p>
<h1 id="so-what">So what</h1>
<p>Is my assessment of Agile estimation too harsh? On paper, the theory seems sound enough. I&rsquo;m sure there are companies that are effectively leveraging it. But I&rsquo;m gradually coming to the conclusion that much of the Agile estimation I&rsquo;ve encountered is actually anti-Agile.</p>
<p>What do you think? Is Agile estimation typically more useful than I suggest? When have you seen it be an effective use of the team&rsquo;s time?</p>
