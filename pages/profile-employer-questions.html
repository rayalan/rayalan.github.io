<p>Successfully searching for a ~~software engineering~~ position resolves two questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the employer want to hire you?</li>
<li>Do you want to work for the employer?</li>
</ul>
<p>While every job has its rough points – or <em><a href="https://wordhistories.net/2021/11/04/where-muck-brass/">where there’s muck, there’s brass</a></em> as the saying goes – the goal is to find a compelling long-term match. Over time, then, I’ve built up my own set of questions<sup id="fnref:posthog"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:posthog">1</a></sup> to ask employers. I don’t explicitly ask all of these questions during the interview process, but they frame what I want to learn about potential employers.</p>
