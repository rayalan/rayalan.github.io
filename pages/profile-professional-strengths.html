<p>Some of the biggest accomplishments in my career are what wasn’t done. Proposals that were abandoned when it became clear that the projects were far more complex than anticipated. Plans for months that were trimmed down to weeks because the core need could be met far more simply. Complex algorithms replaced with a bit of syntactic sugar around existing tooling.</p>

<p>What would you do if you were your nemesis?</p>
<p><em>Alan’s algorithm complexity analysis instructor</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two of my favorite college classes were algorithm complexity analysis (e.g., Big-O notation) and a graduate game theory class that looked at various proposals, such as charging for e-mail and figuring out how much each e-mail would have to cost before spam would cease to be profitable<sup id="fnref:profit"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:profit">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Both classes rewarded my ability to understand a system and find edge cases. What’s the worst that an algorithm can perform? Well, design just the right set of inputs to maximally thwart what it is trying to do.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alan is exceptionally talented at thinking about all aspects of a problem and having a good understanding of a situation that is relayed to him. It seems to be easy for him to even grasp the complexity of subjects he is not familiar with at a glance.</p>
<p><em>Anonymous coworker praise</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>From engineering process plans to system design documents to individual functions, spotting holes, edge cases, and assumptions.</p>
<p>At a macro level, it’s questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the goal is to just evaluate a bunch of images, why not read those images in from the data pipeline into their own isolated system? Given the stated business objectives, we don’t need all the proposed complexity for tying the results back into the data pipeline, including being able to correct the results downstream when they are initially incorrect.</li>
<li>This plan seems to assume all our teams have the same processes for the same kind of work, but is that really true?</li>
<li>Why doesn’t the system have fallback error handling? Do we really expect it is reasonable for developers to always spot and handle any place that an error might occur?</li>
<li>Didn’t we just release a document that says developer time is the most precious resource the company has? What’s the cost-benefit analysis on requiring more detailed tickets from developers? Who is actually going to be using the new ticket information? How will we know if it isn’t going to be useful?</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve written more about these ideas elsewhere, such as about <a href="../the-three-questions">my three fundamental questions</a> and the <a href="./unlinked">shortcomings of blame-free retrospectives</a>.</p>
<p>At a micro level, it’s questions like:
* It’s great that this code is really efficient for the expected input, but what if someone decides to not send the expected input? What happens then?
* Suppose the code fails for some reason writing to the database – does the error get handled? What’s the fallback plan around errors?</p>
<p>In one case, I was discussing user experience decisions, and trying to work out how to represent some difficult concepts in an intuitive way. As the programmatic solutions got more and more complex, I finally said, “Why don’t we just train people on how the system works? We’re delivering an internal product. And it’s going to be a whole lot quicker to train a handful of people for 30 minutes or an hour than it is to spend weeks implementing a more intuitive solution.” I certainly broke the <a href="https://www.uxdesigninstitute.com/blog/ux-design-principles/">premise of learnability</a>, but a far more robust implementation was delivered far faster because of that choice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Taking the time to think deeply about a wide variety of challenges in tech, and help set solutions in motion. Alan’s uniquely good at analysis.</p>
<p><em>Anonymous coworker praise</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In another case, we had a very sensitive system where we weren’t sure of all the problems that might occur in the system or how to handle them. However, there would be tens of thousands of daily calls, and any mishandled call could result in significant problems for customer service, as well as negative publicity.</p>
<p>What I realized, though, is that the calls didn’t have to be handled by the system if it encountered an edge case. So we built in behavior that, if the system hit one of these scenarios, it would add the scenario to a list along with a bit of descriptive text about what went wrong, and a human would go in and handle the situation manually. (We already needed to build this kind of manual tooling for humans to handle other cases.) Whenever developers hit something they thought was rare and hard to code for, I told them to make it another manually handled case. The plan then became this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Periodically review the scenarios that got added to the manual processing queue.</li>
<li>For rare one-off scenarios, do nothing.</li>
<li>For frequently occurring scenarios, go back and solve for future scenarios.</li>
<li>For a massive number of unhandled scenarios, we’d go back and teach the system how to retroactively handle them.</li>
</ul>
<p>We never hit a massive burst of unhandled scenarios. We went back a few times and cleaned up some frequent occurrences. And for years, the system occasionally generated some unexpected scenarios that were often beyond our knowledge of how to recreate or test for. The result was that, for a small ongoing cost in human maintenance, the software shipped faster, it was designed for the common case with robust testing, and a lot of complicated edge scenarios never had to be handled because they never even occurred.</p>
<p>Some day I’ll do a <a href="https://xkcd.com/1205/">detailed cost-benefit analysis</a> on at what point paying developers to enhance the system to handle every actual edge case would be a better deal than paying a human to handle the cases<sup id="fnref:range"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:range">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>These examples illustrate the kind of creative, goal-focused, out-of-the-box thinking I apply to problems and planning. I’m not afraid to step away from conventional wisdom when it doesn’t fit the situation. I see both the big picture (e.g., have a reliable system) and the details (e.g., how complicated is a robust solution to this problem in code going to be?) and move readily back and forth.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/10355848-anyone-can-be-a-critic-but-to-really-create-something">Francis Chapman</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t just spot flaws and problems; I create the necessary structure around me. Not organization for the sake of process, but processes and systems to enable people to do their best work. Given large amounts of unorganized (or even contradictory) information, I can frame the problem and structure not just a one-time solution, but an ongoing approach that allows for future modifications.</p>
<h2 id="example-project-definition">Example: Project definition</h2>
<p>At the beginning of what would become <a href="./profile-experience-showcase#spotlight-billing-system-overhaul">the billing project</a>, someone conducted stakeholder interviews to find out the requirements. And there were a lot of requirements. But I noticed something – most of the requirements were based on the behavior of the existing system, and people had answered the questions as if the goal was to maintain exactly the same behavior that the current system had.</p>
<p>But because we were building a new system, replicating the existing behavior of a legacy home-grown system would be challenging and expensive. Additionally, some of the behaviors just seemed weird – was it really better, for instance, that most billing operations couldn’t be handled by the representatives answering the phone, and instead got passed to other representatives who did the work later? Did sales really like the way that the discount code system worked, or was it simply the system that they had and they didn’t want to lose it?</p>
<p>So I went back and re-interviewed every stakeholder – most of the executives, every department (except human resources<sup id="fnref:hr"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:hr">3</a></sup>), and a bunch of engineers about how the current system operated and why.</p>
<p>What I found out was that most people wanted the system to be different; they just hadn’t envisioned that it would be possible to change it. Customer service desperately wanted the ability to do first call resolution. Finance wanted a simplified reconciliation process. Sales and marketing wanted a totally different approach to discounts. Nobody liked the undocumented legacy behaviors that only maybe 3 people in the company understood. And so on.</p>
<p>So I scrapped the initial requirements. I wrote up how the new system would behave, simplifying many steps. I generated a list of differences from the legacy system. And I made a plan for the big sticking point: How would we smoothly transition from the legacy system to the new system without, say, confusing customers or service representatives? After all, the new system would be largely untested, and there are plenty of horror stories of massive software switches that go boom. The essence of my plan was:</p>
<ol>
<li>Keep the customer service interface very similar to minimize the changes.</li>
<li>Only allow the system-appropriate functionality: e.g., legacy system operations that did not exist in the new system could not be performed.</li>
<li>Do most of the validation with a small number of new system accounts and specially prepared customer service representatives (so that most of them didn’t have to worry about the early stages of testing).</li>
<li>Train the representatives on the new system.</li>
<li>Build new channels for representatives to communicate with my team in a real-time fashion so that any questions or concerns could be rapidly dealt with.</li>
<li>Once the new system was well vetted, do a rapid transition to the new system.</li>
</ol>
<p>All this preparation in hand, I went to the stakeholders and impacted managers and walked them through it. I took feedback, made modifications, addressed concerns, and went back. After a few rounds, I had the support I needed. And that plan would form the backbone of the next eighteen months of work. There were surprises, hiccups, and adjustments, of course. But in the end, the new billing system was far better than the initial requirements, executed far faster than the initial requirements would have allowed, and the transition pain between systems was more than offset by the ability of customer service representatives to have first call resolution for over ninety-five percent of billing-related calls.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think Alan does a great job at organizing how a project goes from point a to point b. Yes, he may not initially know how to get there. But the steps to get there are addressed in a timely manner when they are needed, and an overarching plan/concept exists.</p>
<p><em>Praise from Alan’s peers</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="example-developer-process">Example: Developer process</h2>
<p>Another example of streamlining the developer process is from one project where my team had the fortune to work with a third-party system with a robust ability to store metadata. Metadata storage was the ability to associate an object with many key-value pairs. Each value had very generous length for strings (500 characters, as I recall).</p>
<p>I quickly realized the potential this system had for our work – combined with a robust type checking system and some garbage protection, this system could let developers rapidly implement custom behavior and pass information to other processes, all without going outside the system. The length was sufficient that we could even store JSON strings for a key, allowing us to store complex objects.</p>
<p>(In fact, my team eventually became a bit concerned that my answer for too many problems was “use metadata.” As I recall, they were particularly unimpressed by my suggestion that long JSON strings could be split up and written to multiple keys, and then later reassembled.)</p>
<p>Having experienced the speed and ease of development that the team had experienced from this metadata system, I wanted to give that capability to all developers. For context, at the time, we were working entirely in a relational database, and schema changes were a slow and error-prone process that developers avoided. And for various reasons, spinning up a document-oriented database like, say, MongoDB, wasn’t an option.</p>
<p>Over the next few months, I worked with DBAs to create a similar metadata system in our technologies. And then I worked with developers to create an easy-to-use wrapper so that metadata was easy to use and came with clear transactional guarantees.</p>
<p>The work paid off, and developers on several different projects were able to rapidly implement features using the new capability. Not only that, but shortly after that, we ran into a situation where we needed to perform high-volume one-time writes of key-value pairs – except that the keys weren’t necessarily unique.</p>
<p>Having established the baseline key-value system, the DBAs were able to modify the system to have a high-volume version that supported repetitive keys. This variation allowed developers to leverage a known interface and quickly adapt to the unexpectedly high throughput.</p>

<p>Alan thinks deeply and critically about workflow processes and how to improve/smooth those.</p>
<p><em>Anonymous coworker praise</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="example-rapid-steelmanned-decisions">Example: Rapid steelmanned decisions</h2>
<p>In another situation, I wanted to standardize a number of engineering practices in a heavily consensus-driven culture across a number of teams. There wasn’t a good upfront way of knowing who cared specifically about which decision. Additionally, due to interconnected systems, teams could be unexpectedly impacted by a decision.</p>
<p>I ended up introducing a three-step approach:</p>
<ol>
<li>I’d research and post <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/steelman">steelmanned</a> proposals, including not just the decision, but also the pros and cons of the direction.</li>
<li>Engineers would read and respond with any strong reactions or concerns.</li>
<li>React according to the feedback.</li>
</ol>
<p>Four of the big advantages of this preview / feedback / react cycle were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Establishing a culture of transparency and thoughtful discourse. By sharing my understanding and carefully engaging with differing perspectives, the engineering culture as a whole improved.</li>
<li>By providing enough prospective into the <em>why</em> of a decision, minor concerns or downsides rarely become sticking points. Other engineers could see the reasons driving the decision, and do their own cost-benefit analysis of their own concerns. Often downsides were raised not as blockers, but as a heads-up of something that might need to be mitigated in the future, providing the team (and especially myself) with valuable input.</li>
<li>Swiftly identifying who significantly cared about a decision. Instead of it being a conversation across the entire department, engineers self-identified as concerned parties, quickly focusing the conversation.</li>
<li>Rapidly moving many decisions forward to conclusion. In many cases, there wasn’t significant dissent, at least not once the rationale was laid out. These decisions could be finalized with little overhead.</li>
</ol>
<p>This approach won’t work in every scenario – it requires people be comfortable speaking up; it won’t scale past a certain point; it requires a willingness to cheerfully allow the preliminary proposals to be destroyed by feedback upon occasion.</p>
<p>It was, though, a quick and light-weight approach to rapidly standardizing engineering processes in a consensus-oriented culture while encouraging initiative, feedback, and openness.</p>

<h1 id="relationally-oriented-leadership">Relationally-oriented leadership</h1>
<p><em>There are no technical problems, only people problems.</em> This is one of my favorite witticisms. Major engineering efforts are not primarily about being good with computers, they are about influencing and organizing people over the long haul.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alan is always positive and thoughtful, with good ideas to offer on any topic. He’s tactful in delivery of feedback, and makes allies easily.</p>
<p>Highly communicative and easy to talk to.</p>
<p><em>Anonymous coworker praise</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve written elsewhere about <a href="../my-best-managers">the best bosses</a> and how they influenced me.</p>
<p>Here are a few more ways how I approach leadership…</p>
<h2 id="thoughtful-author-presenter-conversationalist">Thoughtful author, presenter, conversationalist</h2>
<p>When I have something to say, I’m a capable communicator, both with technical and lay audiences. One of my favorite tricks is to compare complex technical topics to ordinary experiences like doing office paperwork or feeding cupcakes to frenzied toddlers. Two of the toughest challenges for me in communicating are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Assessing audience trust in my claims; that is, how much do I need to show my work/reasoning for them to follow along.</li>
<li>Skimping on context because I don’t want to insult my audience. I’m quickly bored (and possibly more than a bit frustrated) when I’m being taught something I already know without a new application or twist. And not wanting to do that to my audience, sometimes I assume my audience has more of a foundation than they do.</li>
</ol>
<p>My hope is that the rest of this blog gives pretty good evidence for my ability to present my ideas with a reasonable degree of clarity and interest.</p>
<h2 id="mentor-listener">Mentor, listener</h2>
<p>Some of my worst experiences have been when I’ve had something to say and nobody will slow down to understand me or take me seriously. Maybe I didn’t get a concept. Maybe I had a concern or a big problem. Maybe I just wasn’t fitting into the expected box.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, the feeling of being marginalized and disregarded hurts deeply. Emotions aside (which do matter), my engineering decisions were worse, not in the least because I was trying to execute without comprehension. Worse yet, I rarely, if ever, have seen those decisions pay off for leadership<sup id="fnref:fear"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:fear">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>As a result, I enjoy small settings, often one-on-one, where individual trust can be established. I find this approach offers me a number of upsides:</p>
<ol>
<li>I can understand each person as an individual. What are their dreams? What motivates them? What do they care about? What do they understand? What are their concerns? Larger meetings are just inefficient if they go into that much depth.</li>
<li>It facilitates communication in both directions, minimizing the number of people that might take issue with an opinion. Being criticized is hard. Losing face is hard. Saying something unpopular is hard, especially in front of a lot of people.</li>
<li>It minimizes the risk of exposing ignorance. While I love the “there are no stupid questions” mantra<sup id="fnref:mantra"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:mantra">5</a></sup>, sometimes engineering culture or the individual level of trust isn’t there. And the exchange of ideas that can happen when one is able to ask “What do you mean by …?” is one of the most critical moments when critical communication is happening.</li>
<li>I can leverage those individual goals and concerns when making broader changes. For example, if I know that Joe is really concerned that the new system will put them in situations where they don’t feel proficient, then I can help address that in the implementation without Joe having to say “Hey, team, I don’t feel proficient with what’s being asked of me.”</li>
</ol>
<p>The result, I find, is that I can create and sustain high-performing teams that are safe places for people to grow – and that I can more quickly adjust the team – or my own behavior – because of those strong individual relationships<sup id="fnref:alternatives"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:alternatives">6</a></sup>. Beyond that, strongly understanding my team and coworkers lets me tailor opportunities to their interests, connect people with aligned interests, and provide highly-applicable resources.</p>
<p>Here’s what my co-workers have said about how this plays out for them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alan works quite hard and always takes time to make sure his team members understand what their responsibilities and expectations are adequately. Despite his busy schedule, Alan is very available for concerns or questions.</p>
<p><em>Anonymous coworker praise</em></p>
<p>Dedication - As referred to before, Alan is extremely thorough in assuring that no workload gets overlooked. If I’m struggling with a Jira card, Alan wants to figure out why and resolve it. We don’t just push the card through, and he doesn’t leave me on my own to fumble through it-he equips me to handle it in an effective manner.</p>

We have a limited capacity as a team and as individuals, so it’s important to know how and when to say no to the different things that vie for our resources and I’ve appreciated the ways you do that. Communicating to stakeholders about our priorities, saying no to individual requests for help when needed, etc.</p>

<p>Communicating critical information. I think I’ve seen this strength the most through encouraging group discussions in Slack channels and things you share when you speak up in meetings. Even before I was working on your team, the thing that stuck out to me the most about you is your ability to analyze a situation thoroughly and communicate the most critical pieces of information effectively.</p>

<p>Compassion and he is driven to serve all well. Alan will hash it out til the cows come home so he has clarity and then he will make decisions based on quality for the entire company not just one aspect of a team.</p>
<p><em>Anonymous coworker praise</em></p>
<p>Respect for others. Alan is always concerned with the opinions and concerns of his teammates and of other teams within the company. He contemplates all feedback with mindfulness and makes sure that everyone he interacts with is heard and their questions are addressed (even if sometimes addressing the question is “I think that’s incorrect because of xyz…”).</p>
<p><em>Anonymous coworker praise</em></p>
<p>Alan is good at delegating work amongst team-members…Alan has a knack for assigning tasks in a way that allows the team to be independently productive and have freedom in our work.</p>
<p>He really cares about his team members as people and is genuinely open to working with them through their individual concerns and goals.</p>

<p>Go after the ball.</p>
<p><em>My dad, best soccer (and life) advice ever</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I played soccer as a child, my dad observed that a lot of children waited around for the ball to get near them – but he taught me to go after the ball. And I learned that, often, I could be the first one there if I hustled.</p>
<p>My team could then move the ball up the field.</p>
<p>Even if I wasn’t first, I could force the other side to hurry and make a choice. Sometimes I’d intercept the ball. Sometimes they’d make a poor pass or kick it out of bounds. And sometimes they’d make a great play. But I learned that forcing the other side to make a quick decision was far better than letting them look for the best possible opportunity.</p>

<p>I carry this idea into work – problems don’t solve themselves, especially not thorny or tough ones. And my willingness to jump in, learn, understand, and then present a structured direction is often invaluable.</p>

<p><em>Alan’s coworkers about him</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>My co-workers consistently acknowledge that I bring movement and momentum to projects.</p>
<p>One time, for example, my company was in negotiations with a critical vendor about some software changes they wanted made. The vendor had leverage (unfortunately), but negotiations seemed to be going well, and we expected to have about a year to make the changes. Then something went badly wrong and we had six weeks to make all the changes or be dropped by the vendor (which wasn’t an acceptable option for the company). And now, suddenly, a problem that had vaguely been on my radar for “sometime in the next year” became an “all hands on deck” crisis.</p>
<p>I planned to ship the changes in three weeks, figuring we’d need the remainder of the six weeks to make any unforeseen adjustments. The first couple of days I spent digging into documentation while one of my best engineers prototyped out a solution. By mid-week, I’d put together a document outlining the plan, specified what work was needed from various teams, recruited the necessary people to this project, and was walking through the plan with executives and team members. I made sure the whole engineering team understood that (a) this project was the priority – pull whatever resources were needed, and (b) we could deviate from standard practices (e.g., being able to test everything in staging) – let me know what they needed. I added a bit of light-weight process – a daily standup, a day-to-day Slack channel, and a stakeholder channel. And I let the developers go at it.</p>
<p>Much of my remaining work was approving painful shortcuts and communicating them to stakeholders and impacted parties. For example, if a customer called in and expected such-n-such support from customer service, it wouldn’t be possible because of these changes. So executives needed to know what trade-offs were being made, and customer service needed to understand how these accounts would behave after the changes.</p>
<p>We shipped in a bit over three weeks, and then spent a couple more weeks tidying up some of the initial sharp edges. The changes got made, the vendor was satisfied, and we kept those customers<sup id="fnref:reflections"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:reflections">8</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Software exists to make customers happy so the company can make a sustainable profit<sup id="fnref2:profit"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:profit">1</a></sup>. Or maybe it exists to satisfy legal requirements so the company avoids fines and other penalties. Sometimes it exists to uphold corporate values<sup id="fnref:opensource"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:opensource">9</a></sup> (e.g., “don’t be evil”).</p>
<p>Fundamentally, then, it exists to solve a problem. And the company probably does not care if software engineering, chemistry, or gardening solves the problem, as long as it is solved. (Conveniently for software engineers, chemistry and gardening are rarely competitive alternatives to a computer.)</p>
<p>Everything else – architecture, security, maintainability, testability, microservices, CI/CD, feature flags, Jira cards, pull requests – is a means to these goals. Many of these techniques didn’t exist thirty years ago, and it’s certainly not clear how many of them will exist in another thirty years.</p>
<p>(Employee happiness is in a weird in-between space. On the one hand, there’s substantial research suggesting that happy, engaged employees are far more productive – not to mention the cost of lost knowledge and replacement if they leave – so employee happiness and retention is very often a means to an end. At the same time, many companies are not purely utilitarian calculators and value outcomes such as people having satisfying work. And since many employees take badly to the suggestion that employee happiness isn’t as essential to the company as the employee would like, it’s really hard to have honest conversations on this topic.)</p>
<p>I once was talking to another developer who wanted to rewrite a few hundred lines of code because some small tweak didn’t fit philosophically into the current architecture. On the one hand, I get it. There is something deeply aesthetically satisfying about building an elegant solution. On the other hand, the business doesn’t care about beautiful code. My question to the developer was: “What’s the value in rebuilding it? We make it work by changing these couple lines in like 5 minutes. Rewriting the way you suggest would take several days, plus increase the risk we forgot about some behavior.”</p>
<p>I really like the <em>WARMED</em> acronym from “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YpFGkG-u1w">Where Does Bad Code Come From?</a>”. That is, businesses care about six outcomes when it comes to code:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>(W)rite</strong>. Developers need to be able to write code.</li>
<li><strong>(A)gree upon</strong> (or argue). Developers need to be able to agree upon what the code does and what it should be.</li>
<li><strong>(R)ead</strong>. Developers need to be able to read existing code and understand what it does.</li>
<li><strong>(M)aintain</strong>. Code needs to be updatable over time. New functionality, new requirements, security patches, and the like will all drive future change.</li>
<li><strong>(E)xecute</strong>. To state the obvious: code needs to run. If it doesn’t run, it isn’t useful.</li>
<li><strong>(D)ebug</strong>. When the code doesn’t do what is expected, developers need to be able to figure out why and how to fix it.</li>
</ul>
<p>One way this played out is that I moved my team to streamline their process with <a href="https://www.hillia.app/">Hillcharts</a> and <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects">GitHub Projects</a>. Why? Because our existing Jira process was high overhead: creating cards, duplicating information, and managing backlogs. And very little of that work was contributing to actually shipping working software.</p>
<ul>
<li>Switching to GitHub Projects meant that the pull request could also serve as the record of work.</li>
<li>Weekly updates to hill charts provided management an overview of project status, giving the essential information without having to read through a bunch of Jira tickets or for the team to constantly manipulate cards to create the “right” impression as to how much work remained.</li>
<li>Even before the change to GitHub, I primarily managed work across the team in terms of goals, not in terms of tickets, so they were largely breaking up work and managing tickets themselves. With the less experienced developers, I’d give them less complex goals and help them chunk up the work if needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The result was that developers spent significantly more time on coding (what they loved doing) and less time manipulating Jira cards (something none of them enjoyed).</p>
<h2 id="adaptable-learner">Adaptable learner</h2>
<p>I don’t know how to solve every problem, but I’ve rarely met a problem I couldn’t figure out how to solve. Over my career, I’ve done a lot with different technology stacks. This variety has taught me to see shared commonality - the concern of pass-by-reference and pass-by-value exists in every language, even if some languages don’t support shallow copies or guaranteeing a reference won’t be changed. It also helps me see the benefits of specific features - a robust non-inheritance oriented typing system such as TypeScript, or first-class functions in Python<sup id="fnref:functions"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:functions">10</a></sup>.</p>
<p>One example of learning on the fly was evaluating three different vendors for a major company initiative. One vendor basically took themselves out of the running with a terrible demo. That left me with two vendors – the primary vendor, and a fallback vendor. Within the company, the primary vendor was assumed to be the right choice. I’d been asked to vet the technical choice in vague terms.</p>
<p>After trying to read through the primary vendor’s documentation, I found myself confused on how their solution would actually be integrated with my company. While I expect some curve balls come with any choice, the domain space should have been a well-understood one, and it shouldn’t have been hard for me to figure out how to use their software.</p>
<p>So I sat down to check my work by doing the same thing with the fallback vendor. After a couple days and a couple exchanges with the secondary vendor, I had mapped out a detailed implementation plan, including most edge cases.</p>
<p>Then I dug into implementation costs. I ended up concluding that going with the primary vendor would cost significantly more because they’d require us to hire their solution team at premium rates, plus allocate a full-time product manager, plus do a significant amount of re-engineering of our own custom systems – and we’d be contractually obligated to move at a certain pace or incur additional costs. In contrast, with the fallback vendor, we’d have to do about the same amount of re-engineering of our own systems, but we could move at our own pace.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, a clearer technical plan and a far cheaper and less restricted implementation plan led to us working out a deal with the fallback vendor – Stripe<sup id="fnref:stripe"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:stripe">11</a></sup>. It wasn’t the initial plan that anyone expected, but the project ended up with a far more solid technical solution because I learned about the domain, assessed how the solutions would work for the specific situation, and advocated strongly for the better solution.</p>

<p>Let’s suppose a human spends about an hour a day handling these special scenarios. Say $30/hr, that’s $7,500 a year. I’m guessing it would have taken at least three developer months to have worked all of those scenarios out. At $100 an hour, that’s 6.4 years to break even. Add in the value of the developers being able to do something else in those three months as well as the costs of increased code complexity and the trade-off is looking pretty good for many business situations. Plus the system might be replaced before then. <a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:range" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">↩</a></p>

<p>Along the same lines, I’m terrified that sometime I’ll utter these four words to an engineer: “Just make it happen.” Engineers are smart, and their concerns are, almost always, incredibly perceptive. I dread rashly jettisoning their advice because I know better and what catastrophic effects might play out. “Oh, we disabled the firewall and used <code>password123</code> because Alan said to make it happen.” 🤦‍♂️</p>
<p>While I’ve learned that my fear isn’t terribly rationale as I’ve never come close to actually saying those words, I’d like to think it at least represents a part of me that recognizes the need to listen carefully to feedback from all directions. <a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:fear" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text">↩</a></p>
