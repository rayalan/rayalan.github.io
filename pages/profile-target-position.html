<p>My goal is to work for organizations where I’ll invest tens of thousands of hours. What kind of place do I want to put that kind of effort into?</p>
<p>Every company is different: engineering cultures differ wildly, job descriptions are often a bit vague or out of date, and even jobs with identical titles and descriptions can be almost unrecognizably different. Beyond the basics (like competent, friendly coworkers), here’s what I’m looking for in an ideal position<sup id="fnref:position"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:position">1</a></sup>.</p>
<h3 id="commitment-to-engineering-excellence">Commitment to engineering excellence</h3>
<p>I suppose no company intentionally commits to bad engineering. But the reality is that many companies easily sacrifice engineering quality when push comes to shove.</p>
<p>I want to work somewhere where there’s a deep commitment by leadership to engineering excellence.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This does not mean that the company has their engineering methodology all together. I’ve often stepped into messy legacy situations and turned haphazard engineering situations into solid practices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It does mean that leadership, including non-engineering leadership, values the importance of engineering quality and is willing to learn about how software engineering works<sup id="fnref:tricky"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:tricky">2</a></sup>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It does mean that leadership connects engineering strategy to the business strategy and understands that certain approaches to engineering will be hard to change.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For example, if one hires a bunch of web developers and then decides that they want a native Android app, that’s a difficult and time-consuming transition, either in new hires or training time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similarly, an engineering strategy based on quality hires and low turnover can cut more corners because of the resulting skill and deep institutional knowledge. But if the company isn’t willing to compensate in a corresponding way, the resulting turnover will short-circuit that approach.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It does not mean that engineering sacrifices are never made. Sometimes there really are critical market windows or a commitment made by someone in sales or other pressing emergencies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="primary-contributor-to-engineering-culture-strategy-process-and-tech-stack">Primary contributor to engineering: culture, strategy, process, and tech stack</h3>
<p>Some of my best work is when I’m connecting business objectives and company values through engineering culture and strategy all the way through to process that drives the day-to-day developer experience.</p>
<p>Does engineering have an ambition of every developer shipping code multiple times a day, yet having code reviews on every pull request? Then someone better figure out how to do code reviews in a way that doesn’t disrupt developers (because they are churning out their own code) and yet results in lightning-fast pull requests (because otherwise requests get stuck in the queue and developers get slowed down by the cognitive load of hopping between their many open requests).</p>
<p>Does the business place more value on being fast to market or on having a state-of-the-art user interface? The answer to that should influence how engineering interacts with user experience as well as what kind of training is expected of developers.</p>
<p>Does the company expect to frequently move developers between teams? Then there probably needs to be a common tech stack across all teams; otherwise, developers are going to get tripped up by constantly changing technologies.</p>
<p>These are some of the most important decisions a company makes about its engineering approach, and I want to be in the middle of that work.</p>
<h3 id="learning-opportunities">Learning opportunities</h3>
<p>I sometimes wonder if part of what drives my love of computers and automation is that I hate boredom, and I’m easily bored by repetitive tasks. So I spend a lot of time trying to figure out how not to repeat a task, and I create great software.</p>
<p>Regardless, I want a work environment where I can tackle new problems, new challenges, new technologies. Sometimes this comes about from iterating on existing products – adding new capabilities or scaling upwards. At other times, it is working on different problems.</p>
<p>I’m particularly drawn to working in a cross-disciplinary environment. I’ve learned a lot from my colleagues with expertise in other fields, such as information architecture, machine learning, user experience, and site-reliability engineering. Some of my best proposals are fusions of ideas from a variety of fields, and I want to continue to being exposed to other disciplines.</p>
<h3 id="freedom-of-action">Freedom of action</h3>
<p>As a kid, I loved soccer, playing the rover (sweeper) position. Was the other team attacking our goal? I’d fill the defensive gaps. Was the ball rolling through empty field? I’d get to it first.<sup id="fnref:first"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:first">3</a></sup> Was my team on offense? I’d be midfield, ready to react if the ball started heading the wrong direction. My job was to read the field and adjust accordingly.</p>
<p>That’s a good metaphor for how I shine at engineering, mixing a healthy dose of prioritization, planning, and structure with on-the-fly flexibility and adjustments. Sometimes there’s a major architectural pain point that surfaces late, or a teammate who needs to be filled in on some key concepts for the work. Sometimes it’s about learning why debugging is hard in the current system and making a plan. At other times, it’s about being the one to say, “Here’s the risk if we go live without making sure that we’ve implemented a proper deadletter queue.” Sometimes it’s about figuring out what technological approach will support the new business objectives.</p>
<p>I want to be positioned where I have the freedom to learn, to understand, and to act – to be consistently tackling what is important and impactful.</p>
<h3 id="colleagues-with-complementary-strengths">Colleagues with complementary strengths</h3>
<p>I want to lean into my strengths and to support others who have <a href="./profile-best-environment.md">complementary strengths</a>.
 I do a lot really well, and even more reasonably well. But just because I can do some basic accounting doesn’t make me a great accountant. Can I do an above-average job of database design? Yes. Can I alleviate the need for a database admin in some situations? Absolutely. But at some point, I’m not a substitute for a true expert.</p>
<p>And then there is work I’m just bad at. The <a href="./unlinked.md">Alan Ray School of Web Design</a> aesthetic just isn’t an effective approach to visual design. And while the right company might be able to turn me into some sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banksy">Banksy</a> figure, realistically, I want to depend on others with the necessary expertise.</p>
<p>Can I do a passable job of running a sales campaign? Maybe.</p>
<p>But a skilled salesperson will run rings around me. And they’ll be stronger if I help them break down what they need from engineering, equip them with quality data, and deliver a reliable product in a timely fashion.</p>
<h1 id="mentor">Mentor</h1>
<p>I want to mentor younger engineers. While hands-on learning is absolutely necessary and counts for a lot, it isn’t a replacement for thoughtful input:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give expert guidance, personalizing their learning to their strengths and weaknesses.</li>
<li>Shave weeks off of projects by pointing out obvious dead-ends.</li>
<li>Quickly adjust designs to account for unexpected problems.</li>
<li>Learn first-hand about what the development experience is like.</li>
<li>Confidently give harder projects to developers, knowing what they are capable of and giving them a chance to grow and show off their skills.</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the years, I’ve mentored a number of developers, including a couple from novice programmers to seasoned senior engineers. And I want to continue that practice.</p>
<h1 id="a-habit-of-coding">A habit of coding</h1>
<p>It’s easy for senior engineers to get away from the day-to-day experiences of development. But I want to maintain that connection to coding – what is the daily experience of engineers? What are the pain points that are hard to justify to management, but act as a constant drag on development? Is it the unreliable CI/CD system? The lack of documentation? The complexity of the system? Hard to read metrics? The lack of solid types?</p>
<p>I do my best work when I’m connecting business objectives all the way through the engineering strategy and processes to the day-to-day development cycle. And that means keeping my hand in coding.</p>
<h1 id="valued">Valued</h1>
<p>I want to work for leadership that appreciates and values what I bring to the company. While I can fill a lot of roles, I combine a rare set of capabilities – e.g., an inquisitive and deeply analytical mind, top-notch software engineering skills, and a knack for communicating with both technical and non-technical audiences. And I want to work for a company that appreciates the rarity of the combination and utilizes my work to propel the company forward.</p>
<p>I’m far more flexible about what the specifics of compensation and title look like – ideas don’t get better just because someone with a fancy title says them<sup id="fnref:title"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:title">4</a></sup>. At the same time, though, I recognize that in America, both compensation and title are often proxies for how much respect someone commands in their position and how much social support one has to initiate and lead change. And so I need to care, perhaps more than I want to, because that kind of soft power is essential to the kind of work I do.</p>
<h1 id="fine-print">Fine Print</h1>
<p>An ideal position for me also includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Remote work environment</em></li>
<li><em>Generous PTO</em> - so I at least have the illusion that I might take time off.</li>
<li><em>Flexible working hours</em> - it’s not much fun to be nickel and diming PTO just because I need to run an errand or swing by the bank during business hours.</li>
</ul>

<li id="fn:position">
<p>No company is perfect, of course, and just like companies are interested in capable employees who aren’t a perfect match for their requirements, I’m certainly interested in strong employers. Who knows, maybe they’ve even built something better than I’ve envisioned. <a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:position" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:tricky">
<p>There’s a tricky balance here - on the one hand, engineering should be earning the trust of other departments by how they operate. On the other hand, certain practices (such as unnecessarily hard deadlines or certain approaches to estimation) can greatly hamper engineering and the transparent flow of information. <a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:tricky" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:first">
<p>Or if an opponent got there first, they would have to make a hasty decision. And it turns out that a pressured decision is often a lot worse than a carefully considered one. <a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:first" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:title">
<p>Or at least, they shouldn’t. <a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:title" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text">↩</a></p>
